title: Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
---

***...and the Privacy Act of 1974.***

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** is any information that can distinguish or trace an individual, either alone or when combined with other information. **Sensitive PII** is information that, if misused, could cause substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to a person. 

No system may store Sensitive PII until it has received an [Authority to Operate](../../ato/). If you are uncertain as to the sensitivity of the information your system may process, please complete a Privacy Threshold Assessment (PTA) or speak with [the GSA Privacy Office](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/category/533866). The ATO process includes a [Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)](../../privacy/pia/) and may also require the creation or update of a [System of Record Notice (SORN)](../../privacy/sorn/). If necessary, those should be initiated as close to the start of the project as possible.

Collecting information that is ancillary to your system's purpose — in a search box, for example — does not necessarily trigger [the Privacy Act](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104250). On the other hand, a system that, for example, prompts people for contact information to later communicate with them is definitely processing PII.

### Always

While the sensitivity of some information is context-specific, there are certain types of information that are always sensitive PII:

* Driver's license or other government identification information
* Social security number (SSN)
* Financial account number(s) (credit cards, bank accounts, etc.)
* Alien Registration Number
* Passport number
* Biometric identifiers
* Passwords

### Paired

Sometimes sensitive PII can be created by pairing different types of PII. Below are some examples of PII that become sensitive if paired and you must always consider sensitivty the overall context:

* Citizenship or immigration status
* Ethnic or religious affiliation
* Mother's maiden name
* Last 4 digits of SSN
* Medical information
* Sexual orientation
* Criminal history
* Date of birth
* Geo-location information
* Military records
* Security clearance 
* Information about spouses or children

### Privacy Act Statement

You must inform people from whom you wish to collect PII why you are requesting it; how you will use it; and what the consequences are, if any, if they don;t provide what you've requested. The goal is to enable the public to make an [informed consent] (https://www.justice.gov/opcl/conditions-disclosure-third-parties#consent). 

Privacy Act Statements must be accessible where the PII is collected; for example, on the webpage where the user inputs information. When drafting a [Privacy Act Statement] (https://gsa.gov/portal/content/162010), use plain languange and make sure to include the following elements:

* The legal authority for collecting the information – statute, executive order, regulation.
* The purpose(s) for collecting the information and how you will use it.
* A reference to the SORN that covers your system; and
* Whether providing the information is mandatory or voluntary and what the effects of not providing the information are – for example the loss or denial of a privilege, benefit, or entitlement.

Once you've drafted the statement, submit it for review to the Privacy Office.
